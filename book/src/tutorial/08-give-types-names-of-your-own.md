# 8. Give types names of your own

There is no built-in `int`. If you want that name, choose its meaning explicitly:

```plenty
type int = i32

def increment(value: int) -> int:
    value + int(1)

def main() -> Result[(), IoError]:
    answer: int = increment(int(41))
    print(answer)?
    Ok(())
```

```output
42
```

`type int = i32` declares a type alias. `int(41)` is exactly the integer cast
`i32(41)`. Another program can choose `type int = i64` instead. Aliases do not
change unconstrained literal defaults, but `answer: int = 41` uses the annotation
to choose the literal's width. `41i32` and `int(41)` are also explicit choices. Aliases are not literal
suffixes, so `41int` is not valid syntax.

Names that describe your data can make interfaces easier to read:

```plenty
type Count = u32
type ItemCount = Count

def add_one(count: ItemCount) -> ItemCount:
    count + 1u32

def main() -> Result[(), IoError]:
    print(add_one(41u32))?
    Ok(())
```

```output
42
```

An alias is another name for the same type. `Count`, `ItemCount`, and `u32`
are interchangeable here; an alias does not create a distinct type, enforce
units of measurement, or add runtime overhead.

Aliases can name integers, booleans, strings, collections, unit, or other aliases.
Numeric aliases support casts; collection aliases support collection constructors. Declare aliases at module scope; they are
visible throughout that file, including before their declaration. Alias chains
must eventually reach a concrete type; cycles and unknown targets are errors.
An alias cannot redefine a built-in name, another alias, or a function name.
