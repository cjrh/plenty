# 12. Explore with small programs

Save an example in a file, edit it, and run it again with `plenty example.plenty`
(or `cargo run -- example.plenty` from this repository). Each run compiles the
complete file and starts a fresh process. Use `--check` for feedback without
running your program.

Use `print(value)` inside `main` to see a value. A final expression is the
function's return value and must match its declared type; `main() -> ()` cannot
end with a bare integer. Parse/type errors run no code. Runtime errors
can occur after earlier effects, such as printing, have already happened.
The run command preserves the program's input, output, and working directory,
and reports a failing exit status when the program fails.

There is no interactive REPL or interpreter, and JIT compilation is out of scope.
