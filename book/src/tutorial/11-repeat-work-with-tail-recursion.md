# 11. Repeat work with tail recursion

A tail-recursive function can repeat work without growing the call stack.
For collection traversal, the next lessons introduce `for` loops.

```plenty
def sum_to(n: i64, total: i64) -> i64:
    if n <= 0:
        return total
    sum_to(n - 1, total + n)

def main() -> Result[(), IoError]:
    print(sum_to(100, 0))?
    Ok(())
```

```output
5050
```

The recursive call is the last operation on that path. Plenty reuses its call
frame in native code. An explicit
`return sum_to(n - 1, total + n)` works too. In contrast, `1 + recurse(...)`
still has addition to do after the call and is not a tail call.
