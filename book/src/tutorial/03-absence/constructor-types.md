# Give constructors enough type information

Constructors get missing type
information from a binding annotation, function parameter, or return signature.
`Some(42)` already contains enough information to infer `Option[i64]`.
`Nothing` has no payload to infer from; `Ok` and `Err` each need the other
variant's type from context:

```plenty
def main() -> Result[(), IoError]:
    found = Some(42)
    missing: Option[i64] = Nothing
    success: Result[i64, str] = Ok(42)
    failure: Result[i64, str] = Err("not ready")
    print(found == Some(42))?
    print(missing == Option[i64].Nothing)?
    match failure:
        case Ok(value):
            print(value)?
        case Err(message):
            print(message)?
    Ok(())
```

```output
True
True
not ready
```

Qualified forms remain available when you want to state all types at the
construction site. A type alias works as well. Without sufficient context, the
compiler asks for a type instead of guessing:

```plenty-error
def main() -> ():
    answer = Ok(42)
```

```error
cannot infer `Ok`
```
