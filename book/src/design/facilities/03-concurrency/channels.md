# Bounded channels

`channel[T](capacity: u64) -> Result[tuple[Sender[T], Receiver[T]], ChannelError]`
constructs a bounded multi-producer, multi-consumer FIFO queue. Capacity must be
positive: zero returns `InvalidCapacity`; size overflow or exhaustion returns
`Allocation(AllocError)`. Failed construction exposes no partial queue.

| Operation | Result | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sender.send(value)` | `Result[(), SendError[T]]` | Wait for space or receiver disconnection |
| `sender.send_nowait(value)` | Same | Return `Full(value)` if no space |
| `receiver.recv()` | `Result[T, RecvError]` | Wait for a message or sender disconnection |
| `receiver.recv_nowait()` | Same | Return `Empty` if no message is ready |
| `endpoint.share()` | Same endpoint type | Create another owner of the queue |

Methods observe endpoints; `mut` is unnecessary. Endpoint assignment moves;
`share()` explicitly retains the queue. Copy and equality are unsupported.
Sending moves affine messages. `SendError[T].Disconnected(value)` and
`Full(value)` own the complete unsent value; blocking send never returns Full.
Receiving transfers one message to one receiver. Shared receivers compete rather
than broadcast. Accepted messages follow insertion order, but concurrent senders
and waiters have no predetermined or strictly fair order.

Construction uses one allocation. Sharing, send, receive, waits, disconnection,
and error handling allocate nothing. `nowait` avoids waiting for queue space/data
but can contend on synchronization; it does not guarantee immediate execution.
Timed operations and receive selection are described [separately](timed-selection.md).

## Disconnection and cleanup

Dropping the last sender wakes receivers, which drain buffered messages before
returning `RecvError.Disconnected`. Dropping the last receiver wakes senders,
returns their pending messages as errors, and drops queued messages.

Endpoints are owned context managers. `with receiver as inbox:` moves the handle
into the scope, lends `&Receiver[T]`, and drops that owner on every normal exit.
Other shared handles remain independent owners.

For a producer whose output might only be partly consumed, place the receiver
guard after its task manager:

```text
with spawn(producer)? as task, receiver as inbox:
    ...
```

Exit then disconnects the receiver before joining the producer. Otherwise drain
its output or explicitly drop the last receiver before joining. Workers must
handle disconnection and terminate.

## Messages

Messages must be concrete wholly owned storable values satisfying the
[worker checks](index.md), even for a channel used on one thread. Recursive data
and sender-based reply paths are supported, but recursive message-type paths
back to a receiver are rejected: a queue retaining its last receiver could
prevent destruction. This conservative check also rejects noncyclic instances of
such a type. Zero-capacity rendezvous is unsupported.
